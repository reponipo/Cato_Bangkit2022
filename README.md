# Cato_Bangkit2022
Cato is a learning app for kids. In this application kids can learn by scanning objects around them or they can scan whatever they want to know. For this project, our group has only focused on one classification, namely body parts. When scanning kids will get identification and explanation function body part what are they scanning. This will be easier for learning and new way kind of learning
